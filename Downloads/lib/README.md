# SQL Library

# How to use: (add to docs)
Set up username, password and url for db by instantiating a Secrets <br />
object using Secrets.java methods. Use Secrets setters at the beginning of your application <br />
`Secrets credentials = new Secrets();` <br />
`secrets.setUsername(username_goes_here);` <br />
`secrets.setPassword(password_goes_here);` <br />
`secrets.setUrl(url_goes_here);` <br />
